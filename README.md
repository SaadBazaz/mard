# mard
An experimental bash in C, with a meme-generator as a separate program

## Why?
This is the only subject where I'm not opting for pass/fail.

### Features:
- Raw Input simulation (you can move the cursor)
- Command History (session only, for now)
- Built-in games and meme-generator
- Simulated system + original system command support
- Multithreaded background processes support
- I/O redirection and pipes support (multiple supported)
- Multicommand support using the AND ("&&") operator
- Helpful error messages
- Easily add new bash functions via the lookup table

### How to run:
1. make
2. ./gbsh

### Tested on:
- Elementary OS: built on it, works as expected.
